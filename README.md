# College-Gate-Pass-Management-System
The Project 'College Gate pass Management System' is to record the details and various activities of the students. It simplifies the task and reduces the paperwork. In this project, we are reducing the paperwork which is done by giving the paper gate pass. We are providing the electronic version of the paper gate pass. Admin is monitoring all the students  and system. In this project, the only faculty is approving the user gate application if they want to allow students  then gate pass system is a pop-up on website. Admin enters the student details and press create gate pass button. All details which is entered by admin, stored in database and a pdf is created as a proof of gatepss. Security guard checks database if all details  are correct as in gatepass pdf then he allows student to go. Training has been provided timely basis and they got trained as the Gatepass System is new and rolled out to their area of responsibility. At the moment we are in the very early stages, so it is dificult to put a specific time on the training, but we will keep people informed as plans are developed. The system is very user-friendly and it is anticipated that functions of the system are easily accessed by administrators and Faculties
